0-What is Java-
It is opn source prograames.

1-Features of JavA

	Simlpe-
		1-user frindaly.
		2-Garbage collector.
		3-Easy syntx

	Architecherl Netural- Wroks with differtn PC proceers
	Mutltrhard-Java has Threading.  
	Robut-
		Garbage collector
		No poniter in JAVA
	Secure
		Because its code is converted in bytecode once our prograame is compileed

	Platform indepenedt- Programe/software develped in java can run on pc even if it has diffenrt configrraution. We need JDK or JRK. 
	Object Orinent lanuage- OOPs- In java we do prgamging on the bassic of Class and object approach.
		Class	
		Object	
		Polyformisme
		Inhertance
		Absctraction
		
3-What are then JVM, JRE and JDK.
JVM- It not physically exits. It works to convert java code into bytecode and compile the prograame.
JRE- Java runtime envirment. It physically exits. It is the prat of JDK. It has the ability to run a prgaame. It has set of libires and tool to run a prgaame.
JDK- It is complten kit. It has ability to run any prograame or applet or j2ee.
	
2-Varibales in Java
Varibales- thesr are idnerntifires that holds the identification of value that can be changed. 
		1-Varibale name shold be unique.
		2-Variable sould strat either form ablphate or _
		3-Keyword  shoid not be used as variables

		Differnt type of variables:- (Will be coverd in CLass and Object session)
		local variables
		Instance Variables
		Static Variables

3-Datatype in Java-
It is the type of the data. Diffent kind of datatye
	1-Primitive data type- Predefined datatype by JAVA.
		1-byte
		2-short
		3-int-12-32-bit
		4-long-12-64 bits
		5-float-12.0-32 bits
		6-doble-12.0-64 bits
		7-boolean-true, false - 1 bit
		8-char-ad-16 16-bit unicode
		
	
	2-Non-Primitive-The data type those customized. It refers to object and we can never change the.
		1-String 
		2-Array
	
	

4-Basic prograames
5-Operatores in Java
	It tells the comlier to perform action on varibnlaes
	Differnt types of operaters
	1-Arithmatic 
		+,_,*,/,%
	2-Relational 
		<,<=,>,>=,==,!=
	3-Logical 
		&&-Loical and,!!-Logical or, !-Logical not
	4-Assignment 
		=-simmple assignemnt
		+=-Add and assignment
		-=-Subsctract and assignemnt
		*=-Mutliple and assignment
		/=-Divide and assignent
	5-Bitwise
		&-Binary and operaters
		|-Binary or 
		^-Binary XOR
		~-Binary one complemnt
		<<-Binanry right shift
		>>-Binary left shift
		
6-Basic prograames
7-Access Modifiers in Java
	We user modifiers to define the scope of a class and funtion and variables.
	Kind of modifiers
		Default:-It has scopde with in the same paksges
		Public:IT has scope everywhere
		Protacted:It has scope in within the pakage and all the sub classes.
		private: It has scope only witnin the class
		
8-Loop and conditions
	1- If statemnt
	2- If else statment
	3- for loop
	4- while loop
	5- do while loop
	6- switch
