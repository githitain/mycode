Loop and conditions
Strings- Immutable(We cannot changes the its attributes's values), an object, array of characters.
declarations-
	String s1;
	String s1="Selenim"	
	String str = new String();
	String str = new String("Selenum");
	String str = new String(new Stringbuider);
	String str = new String(new Stringbuider);
	
Stringbuffer- We use this to create mutable string. It is thread-safe.
Stringbuider- We use this to create mutable string. It is not thread-safe.
Arrays-It is a containr tht a fixed number of values of sigle type.
	Declration-
		Int[]arrayname;
		Int arrayname[];
	Constrcting 
		Int[]arrayname= new int[10];
		Int arrayname[]Int[]arrayname;
	Initializing 
		Int[]arrayname= {1,2,3,4,4};
		arrayname[0]=1;
		arrayname[1]=2;
		arrayname[2]=3;
		arrayname[3]=4;

Expection Handing
	Error-Out of socpe
	Expection-anyting unwanted behaviour tht haapens due to proggming flow, mismathc data etc.
	Runtime and comple time
Why It is required
		to control the proggming flow
		we can throws the expections.
		printStackTrace-with line numebr and tells us the exact reason of error or expections. It describe us the effected area.
		
Keyword/compenets of expection handling
	try-it is the start black where we keep or logic or proggmes.
	catch- It is the ending block where we keep expections or errr.
	throw- When we want to throw an expection explicityly.
	throws-It throws the expection implicitly. It comes/hanlded by its method.
	finaaly-It is optiionl but if you keep this blok in ur try catch it will be executed either the error has come or not.It is used for clean-up process.

Types of expception-
	1-Checked expception-These expections are chekced at complile time.
		1-Filenotfound
		2-I-O expception
		3-IllegalSytex errr
		4-ClassNotFound
	2-Uncheked expection- These expections are not chekced at complile time. 
		1-Arithmatic expection
		2-Nullpointer expception
		3-Arrayindexoutofbound
	
	
Files I/O	
Java performs I/O using streams.
	Byte Strema- I/O using bytes
	Character Stream- I/O using characters
